# Car-Loan-Approval-Modeling

This is a good example of modeling imbalance data in classification problem.

Problem Statement -

This is an example of simplified classification model.
Objective of this exercise is to predict if we can approve car loans for some applicants.
Train data provided with TARGET variable 1 or 0. We have to run and check performance on TEST data
